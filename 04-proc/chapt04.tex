\chapter{Void methods}

So far we've only written short programs that have a single class with a \java{main} method.
In this chapter, we'll show you how to organize longer programs into multiple methods and classes.
%We will also take a look at separate compilation.

\index{method}

% ABD: In theory I like the idea of providing a chapter overview, but
% in practice I find them impossible to write without breaking the rules
% (like using terms before defining them, etc)

At a conceptual level, a {\bf method} represents a mathematical {\em function} or a general {\em procedure}.
Some methods perform a computation and return a result.
For example, \java{Math.sqrt(25)} returns the value \java{5.0}.
Other methods (including \java{main}) carry out a sequence of actions without returning a result.
Java uses the keyword \java{void} to declare such methods.
Regardless whether they return a value or not, methods enable you to break down a complex program into smaller blocks of code.

\section{Math methods}

\index{Math class}
\index{class!Math}
\index{expression}
\index{argument}

In mathematics, you have probably seen functions like $\sin$ and $\log$, and you have learned to evaluate expressions like $\sin(\pi/2)$ and $\log(1/x)$.
First, you evaluate the expression in parentheses, which is called the {\bf argument} of the function.
Then you can evaluate the function itself, maybe by punching it into a calculator.

This process can be applied repeatedly to evaluate more complex expressions like $\log(1/\sin(\pi/2))$.
First we evaluate the argument of the innermost function, then evaluate the function itself, and so on.

The Java library includes a \java{Math} class that provides most common mathematical operations.
%These functions are called {\bf methods}.
\java{Math} is in the \java{java.lang} package, so you don't have to import it.
You can invoke Math methods like this:

\begin{code}
    double root = Math.sqrt(17.0);
    double angle = 1.5;
    double height = Math.sin(angle);
\end{code}

The first line sets \java{root} to the square root of 17.
The third line finds the sine of the value of \java{angle}.

\index{degrees}
\index{radians}

Arguments of the trigonometric functions---\java{sin}, \java{cos}, and \java{tan}---should be in {\em radians}.
To convert from degrees to radians, you can divide by 180 and multiply by $\pi$.
Conveniently, the \java{Math} class provides a \java{final double} named \java{PI} that contains an approximation of $\pi$:

\begin{code}
    double degrees = 90;
    double angle = degrees / 180.0 * Math.PI;
\end{code}

Notice that \java{PI} is in capital letters.
Java does not recognize \java{Pi}, \java{pi}, or \java{pie}.
Also, \java{PI} is the name of a variable, not a method, so it doesn't have parentheses.
The same is true for the constant \java{Math.E}, which approximates Euler's number.

It turns out that converting to/from radians is a common operation, so the \java{Math} class provides methods for that.

\begin{code}
    double radians = Math.toRadians(180.0);
    double degrees = Math.toDegrees(Math.PI);
\end{code}

\index{type!long}

If you haven't already, take a look at the documentation for \java{Math} so you know what methods are provided.
For example, another useful method is \java{round}, which rounds a floating-point value to the nearest integer and returns a \java{long}.

\begin{code}
    long x = Math.round(Math.PI * 20.0);
\end{code}

In Java, \java{int} values are stored using 32 bits (4 bytes) of memory, whereas \java{long} values are stored in 64 bits (8 bytes).
As a result, \java{long} variables can represent much larger integers.
In the above example, the multiplication happens first, before the method is invoked.
The result is 63 (rounded up from 62.8319).

\subsection{Composition revisited}

\index{composition}
\index{expression}

Just as with mathematical functions, Java methods can be {\bf composed}.
That means you can use one expression as part of another.
For example, you can use any expression as an argument to a method:

\begin{code}
    double x = Math.cos(angle + Math.PI / 2);
\end{code}

This statement takes the value \java{Math.PI}, divides it by two, and then adds the result to the value of the variable \java{angle}.
The sum is then passed as an argument to \java{cos}.
You can also take the result of one method and pass it as an argument to another:

\begin{code}
    double x = Math.exp(Math.log(10.0));
\end{code}

In Java, the \java{log} method always uses base $e$.
So this statement finds the log base $e$ of 10, and then raises $e$ to that power.
The result gets assigned to \java{x}.
%Do you know what it is without reaching for a calculator?

When using \java{Math} methods, it is a common error to forget to specify the class name \java{Math}.
For example, \java{Math.pow} takes two arguments and raises the first argument to the power of the second.

\begin{code}
    pow(2.0, 10.0);  // syntax error
\end{code}

If you try to invoke \java{Math.pow} this way, the compiler will say it ``cannot find symbol'' (i.e., there is no method named \java{pow} in the current class).


\section{Adding new methods}
\label{adding_methods}

\index{method!definition}
\index{main}
\index{method!main}

Like the \java{Math} class, you can write your own set of methods for use in other programs.
%One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to add new methods.
Let's revisit the method definition for \java{main}:

\begin{code}
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
\end{code}

\index{public}
\index{void}
\index{type!void}

The first line contains information about the method:
\java{main} is a \java{public} method, which means it can be invoked from other classes;
it is a \java{static} method, but we're not going to explain what that means yet;
and it is a \java{void} method, which means that it doesn't yield a result (unlike the \java{Math} methods).

\index{parameter}

The statement in parentheses declares a parameter named
\java{args}.  A {\bf parameter} is a variable that stores an argument.
This parameter has type \java{String[]}, which means that whoever invokes \java{main} must provide an array of Strings (we'll get to arrays in a later chapter).

You can define other methods using syntax is similar to \java{main}:

\begin{code}
    public static void NAME(PARAMETERS) {
        STATEMENTS
    }
\end{code}

By convention, methods start with a lower case letter and use ``camel case,'' which is a cute name for {\tt jammingWordsTogetherLikeThis}.
You can use any name you want for your method, except \java{main} or any of the Java keywords.

% TODO: check where there first use of ``invoke'' was
% TODO: move the definition of ``argument'' to Ch3?

The list of parameters specifies what values, if any, you have to provide in order to invoke the new method.
The first methods we are going to write have no parameters, so the parameter list is empty.  Here's an example:

\begin{code}
    public static void newLine() {
        System.out.println();
    }
\end{code}

The name of this method is \java{newLine}.
It contains only one statement, which prints a blank line.
In {\tt main}, we can invoke the new method like this:

\begin{code}
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("First line.");
        newLine();
        System.out.println("Second line.");
    }
\end{code}

Because \java{newLine} is in the same class as \java{main}, we don't have to specify the class name.
The output of this program is:

\begin{stdout}
First line.

Second line.
\end{stdout}

Notice the extra space between the lines.
If we wanted more space between them, we could invoke the same method repeatedly:

\begin{code}
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("First line.");
        newLine();
        newLine();
        newLine();
        System.out.println("Second line.");
    }
\end{code}

Or we could write a new method that prints three blank lines:

\begin{code}
    public static void threeLine() {
        newLine();
        newLine();
        newLine();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("First line.");
        threeLine();
        System.out.println("Second line.");
    }
\end{code}

You can invoke the same method more than once, and you can have one method invoke another.
In this example, \java{main} invokes \java{threeLine}, and \java{threeLine} invokes \java{newLine}.

%In {\tt threeLine} I wrote three statements all on the same line, which is syntactically legal (remember that spaces and new lines usually don't change the meaning of a program).
%It is usually a good idea to put each statement on its own line, but I sometimes break that rule.

You might wonder why it is worth the trouble to create new methods.
There are many reasons, but this example demonstrates a few of them:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Creating a new method gives you an opportunity to give a name to a group of statements, which makes code easier to read and understand.
%Methods simplify a program by hiding complex computations behind a single statement, and by using English words in place of arcane code.
%Which is clearer, {\tt newLine} or {\tt System.out.println()}?

\item Creating a new method can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code.
For example, to print nine consecutive new lines, you could invoke \java{threeLine} three times.

\item A common problem-solving technique is to break things down into sub-problems.
Methods allow you to focus on each sub-problem in isolation, and then compose them into a complete solution.

\end{enumerate}

%In Section~\ref{methods} we will come back to this question and list some additional benefits of dividing programs into methods.

%Perhaps most importantly, organizing your code into multiple methods allows you to test individual parts of your program separately.


\section{Classes and methods}

\index{class}
\index{method}

Pulling together the code from the previous section, the complete program looks like this:

\begin{code}
public class NewLine {

    public static void newLine() {
        System.out.println();
    }

    public static void threeLine() {
        newLine();
        newLine();
        newLine();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("First line.");
        threeLine();
        System.out.println("Second line.");
    }
}
\end{code}

\index{case-sensitive}

The first line is the class definition.
Class names should be capitalized; this convention helps readers tell the difference between classes and methods in your source code.
The \java{NewLine} class contains three \java{void} methods: \java{newLine}, \java{threeLine}, and \java{main}.
Java is a case-sensitive language, so \java{NewLine} and \java{newLine} are considered different.

\subsection{Programs with multiple methods}

\index{order of execution}

When you look at a class definition that contains several methods, it is tempting to read it from top to bottom.
But that is likely to be confusing, because that is not the {\bf order of execution} of the program.

Execution always begins at the first statement of \java{main}, regardless of where it is in the source file.
In the previous example, we deliberately put \java{main} at the bottom of the program.
Statements are executed one at a time, in order, until you reach a method invocation.
Think of method invocations as a detour in the flow of execution.
Instead of going to the next statement, you go to the first line of the invoked method, execute the statements there, and then come back and pick up again where you left off.

That sounds simple enough, but remember that one method can invoke another one.
In the middle of \java{main}, we go off to execute the statements in \java{threeLine}.
But while we are executing \java{threeLine}, we go off to execute \java{newLine}.
Then \java{newLine} invokes \java{println}, which causes yet another detour.

Fortunately, Java is adept at keeping track of where it is.
So when \java{println} completes, it picks up where it left off in \java{newLine}, and then gets back to \java{threeLine}, and then finally gets back to \java{main} so the program can terminate.
In summary, when you read a program, don't read from top to bottom.
Instead, follow the flow of execution.

%Technically, the program does not terminate at the end of \java{main}.
%Instead, execution picks up where it left off in the program that invoked \java{main}, which is the Java interpreter.
%The interpreter takes care of things like deleting windows and general cleanup, and {\em then} the program terminates.


\section{Parameters and arguments}

\index{parameter}
\index{argument}

Some of the methods we have used require arguments, which are values that you provide when you invoke the method.
For example, to find the sine of a number, you have to provide the number.
So \java{sin} takes a \java{double} as an argument.
To print a message, you have to provide the string.
So \java{println} takes a \java{String} as an argument.
Some methods take more than one argument.
For example, \java{Math.pow} takes two \java{double}s: the base and the exponent.

When you use a method, you provide the arguments.
When you write a method, you list the parameters.
The parameter list indicates what arguments are required.
Here's a method that takes a string and prints it twice:

\begin{code}
    public static void printTwice(String s) {
        System.out.println(s);
        System.out.println(s);
    }
\end{code}

\java{printTwice} has a parameter named \java{s} with type \java{String}.
The parameter name hints that it is a {\tt String}, but you could use any legal variable name.
When we invoke \java{printTwice}, we have to provide an argument with type \java{String}.
Before the method executes, the argument gets assigned to the parameter.

In this example, the argument \java{"Don't make me say this twice!"} gets assigned to the parameter \java{s}.

\begin{code}
    printTwice("Don't make me say this twice!");
\end{code}

\index{parameter passing}

This process is called {\bf parameter passing} because the value gets passed from outside the method to the inside.
An argument can be any kind of expression, so if you have a {\tt String} variable, you can use it as an argument:

\begin{code}
    String argument = "Never say never.";
    printTwice(argument);
\end{code}

The value you provide as an argument must have the same type as the parameter.
For example, if you try:

\begin{code}
    printTwice(17);  // syntax error
\end{code}

You will get the compiler error ``cannot find symbol,'' which might be confusing.
Java is looking for a method named \java{printTwice} that can take an integer.
Since there isn't one in the current class, Java can't find such a ``symbol.''

There are some apparent exceptions to this rule, because sometimes Java converts from one type to another automatically.
For example, \java{Math.sqrt} requires a \java{double} value.
If you run \java{Math.sqrt(25)}, the interger value \java{25} is automatically converted to the floating-point value \java{25.0}.

\java{System.out.println} can accept any type as an argument.
But generally speaking, that is an exception; most methods are not so accommodating.


\section{Stack diagrams and scope}
\label{stack}

\index{stack diagram}
\index{diagram!stack}

Pulling together the code examples from the previous section, here is a complete
class definition:

\begin{code}
public class PrintTwice {

    public static void printTwice(String s) {
        System.out.println(s);
        System.out.println(s);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String argument = "Never say never.";
        printTwice(argument);
    }

}
\end{code}

Parameters and other variables only exist inside their own methods.
Within the confines of \java{main}, there is no such thing as \java{s}.
If you try to use it there, the compiler will complain.
Similarly, inside \java{printTwice} there is no such thing as \java{argument}.
That variable belongs to the \java{main} method.

One way to keep track of where each variable is defined is to draw a {\bf stack diagram}.
The stack diagram for this example looks like this:

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics{stack.pdf}
\caption{Stack diagram for the \java{PrintTwice} program.}
\end{figure}

\index{frame}

For each method there is a box called a {\bf frame} that contains the method's parameters and variables.
The name of the method appears outside the frame.
The value of each variable is drawn inside a box with the name of the variable beside it. (Note for people who know too much: this diagram leaves out a detail we will explain later.)

Stack diagrams help you to visualize the {\bf scope} of a variable, which is the area of a program where a variable exists.
It's possible to have two variables with the same name in two different methods.
Each only exists within its own method, so they don't interfere with each other.


\section{Tracing code using a debugger}

\index{debugger}

Keeping track of variables and methods on paper is a useful skill, and you should practice drawing stack diagrams.
Another way to visualize the scope of variables and the flow of execution is to use a {\bf debugger}.
The overall process is the same, regardless which development environment you use:

\index{breakpoint}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Set {\bf breakpoints} on lines where you want the program to pause.
\item Step through the code one line at a time and watch what it does.
\item Check the values of variables and see when they change.
\end{enumerate}

For example, open any program in DrJava and move the cursor to the first line of \java{main}.
Press Ctrl+B to toggle a breakpoint on the current line; it should now be highlighted in red.
Press Ctrl+Shift+D to turn on Debug Mode; a new pane should appear at the bottom of the window.
(These commands are also available from the {\em Debugger} menu, in case you forget the shortcut keys.)

\index{call stack}

When you the your program, execution pauses at the first breakpoint.
The debug pane shows the {\bf call stack}, with the current method on top of the stack.
You might be surprised to see how many methods were called before the \java{main} method!
To the right are several buttons that allow you to step through the code at your own pace.
You can also press ``Automatic Trace'' to watch DrJava run your code one line at a time.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{debugger.png}
\caption{Screenshot of the DrJava debugger.
Execution is currently paused on the first line of \java{printTwice}.
There is a breakpoint on the first line of \java{main}.}
\end{figure}

When the program is paused, you can examine (or even change) the value of any variable using the Interactions Pane.
This feature allows you to verify your assumptions about how data is passed from one method to another.
You can edit your code while debugging it, but the changes won't take effect until after you compile.
The result can be confusing, so we don't recommend it.
%The debugger may get out of sync if you add or delete multiple lines of code while the program is paused.

Using a debugger is like having the computer proofread your code out loud.
You might expect the code do one thing, and then the debugger shows it doing something else.
At that moment, you gain insight about what may be wrong with the code.


\section{Methods with multiple parameters}
\label{time}

\index{parameter!multiple}
\index{method!multiple parameter}
\index{class!Time}

The syntax for declaring and invoking methods with multiple parameters is a common source of confusion.
For one, you have to declare the type of every parameter separately.

\begin{code}
    public static void printTime(int hour, int minute) {
        System.out.print(hour);
        System.out.print(":");
        System.out.println(minute);
    }
\end{code}

It might be tempting to write ``\java{int hour, minute}'' but that format is only legal for variable declarations, not parameter lists.
Another common source of confusion is that you do not have to declare the types of arguments.
The following is incorrect:

\begin{code}
    int hour = 11;
    int minute = 59;
    printTime(int hour, int minute);  // syntax error
\end{code}

In this case, Java can tell the type of \java{hour} and \java{minute} by looking at their declarations.
It is unnecessary (and therefore not allowed) to include the type when you pass them as arguments.
The correct syntax is:

\begin{code}
    printTime(hour, minute);
\end{code}


% TODO: consider moving the following section later, after students
% start writign methods that return values

%\section{Methods that return values}
%
%\index{value method}
%\index{method!value}
%
%Some of the methods we are using, like the {\tt Math} methods, return values.
%Other methods, like {\tt println} and {\tt newLine}, perform an action but they don't return a value.
%That raises some questions:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%
%\item What happens if you invoke a method and you don't do anything with the result?
%(In other words, if you don't assign it to a variable or use it as part of a larger expression?)
%
%\item What happens if you use a \java{print} method as part of an expression? For example: \java{System.out.println("boo!") + 7;}
%
%\item Can we write methods that return values, or are we stuck with things like \java{newLine} and \java{printTwice}?
%
%\end{itemize}
%
%The answer to the third question is ``yes, you can write methods that return values,'' and we'll see how in a couple of chapters.
%It's up to you to answer the other two questions by trying them out.
%In fact, any time you have a question about what is legal or illegal in Java, a good way to find out is to ask the compiler.
%If you're using DrJava, you can quickly try out these examples in the Interactions Pane.


\section{A few more details}

Now that you've had some experience with \java{double} and \java{Scanner}, there are a few unexpected behaviors we want to warn you about.

\subsection{Rounding errors}

%The operations we have seen so far---addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division---also work on floating-point values, although you might be interested to know that the underlying mechanism is completely different.
%In fact, most processors have special circuitry just for performing floating-point operations.

\index{rounding error}

On hardware, floating-point numbers are only approximately correct.
Some numbers, like reasonably-sized integers, can be represented exactly.  
But repeating fractions, like $1/3$, and irrational numbers, like $\pi$, cannot.
To represent these numbers, computers have to round off to the nearest floating-point number.
The difference between the number we want and the floating-point number we get is called {\bf rounding error}.

%Notwithstanding, there is a fundamental flaw with floating-point arithmetic.
%In mathematics, there is an infinite number of real numbers.
%But computer processors are finite; they cannot represent {\em every} possible floating-point number.
%Even with double-precision, you will frequently run into problems.

\index{arithmetic!floating-point}

For example, the following two statements should be equivalent:

\begin{code}
    System.out.println(0.1 * 10);
    System.out.println(0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1
                     + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1);
\end{code}

But on many machines, the output is:

\begin{stdout}
    1.0
    0.9999999999999999
\end{stdout}

The problem is that \java{0.1}, which is a terminating fraction in base 10, is a repeating fraction in base 2.
So its floating-point representation is only approximate.
When we add up the approximations, the rounding errors accumulate.

For many applications, like computer graphics, encryption, statistical analysis, and multimedia rendering, floating-point arithmetic has benefits that outweigh the costs.
But if you need {\em absolute} precision, use integers instead.
For example, consider a bank account with a balance of \$123.45:

\begin{code}
    double balance = 123.45;  // potential rounding error
\end{code}

In this example, balances will become inaccurate over time as the variable is used in arithmetic operations like deposits and withdrawals.
The result would be angry customers and potential law suits.
You can avoid the problem by representing the balance as an integer:

\begin{code}
    int balance = 12345;      // total number of cents
\end{code}

This solution works as long as the number of cents doesn't exceed the largest integer, which is about 2 billion.
If necessary you can use \java{long} instead, which has a max value of $2^{63}-1$ (about 92 quadrillion dollars).
Hopefully nobody will ever need that much money!


\subsection{The Scanner bug}

Consider a simple program that asks users for their name and age.
Somewhere in the middle of the code, we have the following lines:

\begin{code}
    System.out.print("What is your name? ");
    name = in.nextLine();
    System.out.print("What is your age? ");
    age = in.nextInt();
    System.out.printf("Hello %s, age %d\n", name, age);
\end{code}

The output of the \java{printf} statement looks something like this:

\begin{stdout}
    Hello Darth Vader, age 45
\end{stdout}

When you read a \java{String} followed by an \java{int}, everything works just fine.
But when you read an \java{int} followed by a \java{String}, something strange happens.

\begin{code}
    System.out.print("What is your age? ");
    age = in.nextInt();
    System.out.print("What is your name? ");
    name = in.nextLine();
    System.out.printf("Hello %s, age %d\n", name, age);
\end{code}

Try running the above example.
It doesn't let you input your name and immediately displays the output:

\begin{stdout}
    What is your name? Hello , age 45
\end{stdout}

To understand what is happening, recall that computers do not {\em see} input as multiple lines as we do.
Instead, the operating system simply forwards a stream of characters to your program via \java{System.in}:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{vader1.pdf}
\end{center}

The up-arrow represents the next character to be read.
When you call \java{nextInt}, the \java{Scanner} class will read characters until a non-digit is found.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{vader2.pdf}
\end{center}

At this point, \java{nextInt} returns the \java{int} value \java{45}.
The program then asks \java{"What is your name? "} and calls \java{nextLine}.
\java{Scanner} will read characters until a newline is found.
Since the next character to be read already is a newline, \java{nextLine} returns the empty string \java{""}.

To solve this problem, you need to add an extra call to \java{nextLine} after you call \java{nextInt}.

\begin{code}
    System.out.print("What is your age? ");
    age = in.nextInt();
    in.nextLine();  // read the newline
    System.out.print("What is your name? ");
    name = in.nextLine();
    System.out.printf("Hello %s, age %d\n", name, age);
\end{code}

This technique is common when reading \java{int} or \java{double} values that appear on their own line.
First you read the number, then you read the rest of the line (which is just a newline character).
Note that you do not have to assign the return value of \java{nextLine} to a variable in that case; you can simply ignore it.
