\chapter{Object-oriented programming}

If you haven't done the exercises in Chapters~\ref{gridworld} and \ref{gridworld2}, you should do them before reading this chapter.
As a reminder, you can find the documentation for the GridWorld classes at \url{http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkapjava/javadoc/gridworld/}.

Part 3 of the GridWorld Student Manual presents the classes that make up GridWorld and the interactions among them.
It is an example of object-oriented design and an opportunity to discuss OO design issues.

But before you read the Student Manual, there are a few more things you need to know.


\section{Programming paradigms}

\index{programming language}
\index{language!programming}
\index{programming style}
\index{object-oriented programming}
\index{functional programming}
\index{procedural programming}
\index{programming!object-oriented}
\index{programming!functional}
\index{programming!procedural}

There are many programming languages and almost as many programming styles (sometimes called paradigms).
The programs we have written so far are {\bf procedural}, because the emphasis has been on specifying computational procedures.

Most Java programs are {\bf object-oriented}, which means that the focus is on objects and their interactions.
Here are some of the characteristics of object-oriented programming:

\begin{itemize}

\item Objects often represent entities in the real world.
In the previous chapter, creating the \java{Deck} class was a step toward object-oriented programming.

\item The majority of methods are object methods (like the methods you invoke on \java{Strings}) rather than class methods (like the \java{Math} methods).
The methods we have written so far have been class methods.
In this chapter we write some object methods.

\item Objects are isolated from each other by limiting the ways they interact, especially by preventing them from accessing  instance variables without invoking methods.

\item Classes are organized in family trees where new classes extend existing classes, adding new methods and replacing others.

\end{itemize}

In this chapter I translate the \java{Card} program from the previous chapter from procedural to object-oriented style.
You can download the code from this chapter from \url{http://thinkapjava.com/code/Card3.java}.


\section{Inheritance}
\index{inheritance}

The language feature most often associated with object-oriented programming is {\bf inheritance}.
Inheritance is the ability to define a new class that is a modified version of an existing class.
%
Extending the metaphor, the existing class is sometimes called the {\bf parent} class and the new class is called the {\bf child}.

The primary advantage of this feature is that you can add methods and instance variables without modifying the parent.
This is particularly useful for Java classes, since you can't modify them even if you want to.

If you did the GridWorld exercises (Chapters~\ref{gridworld} and \ref{gridworld2}) you have seen examples of inheritance:

\begin{code}
public class BoxBug extends Bug {
    private int steps;
    private int sideLength;

    public BoxBug(int length) {
        steps = 0;
        sideLength = length;
    }
}
\end{code}

\java{BoxBug extends Bug} means that \java{BoxBug} is a new kind of \java{Bug} that inherits the methods and instance variables of \java{Bug}.
In addition:

\begin{itemize}

\item The child class can have additional instance variables; in this example, \java{BoxBug}s have \java{steps} and \java{sideLength}.

\item The child can have additional methods; in this example, \java{BoxBugs} have an additional constructor that takes an integer parameter.

\item The child can {\bf override} a method from the parent; in this example, the child provides \java{act} (not shown here), which overrides the \java{act} method from the parent.

\end{itemize}

If you did the Graphics exercises in Appendix~\ref{graphics}, you saw another example:

\begin{code}
public class MyCanvas extends Canvas {

    public void paint(Graphics g) {
        g.fillOval(100, 100, 200, 200);
    }
}
\end{code}

\java{MyCanvas} is a new kind of \java{Canvas} with no new methods or instance variables, but it overrides \java{paint}.

If you didn't do either of those exercises, now is a good time!


\section{Object-oriented design}
\index{object-oriented design}

Inheritance is a powerful feature.
Some programs that would be complicated without it can be written concisely and simply with it.
Also, inheritance can facilitate code reuse, since you can customize the behavior of existing classes without having to modify them.

On the other hand, inheritance can make programs hard to read.
When you see a method invocation, it can be hard to figure out which method gets invoked.

Also, many of the things that can be done with inheritance can be done as well or better without it.
A common alternative is {\bf composition}, where new objects are composed of existing objects, adding new capability without inheritance.

Designing objects and the relationships among them is the topic of {\bf object-oriented design}, which is beyond the scope of this book.
But if you are interested, I recommend {\em Head First Design Patterns}, published by O'Reilly Media.

\section{The class hierarchy}
\index{class hierarchy}
\index{Object}
\index{parent class}
\index{class!parent}

In Java, all classes extend some other class.
The most basic class is called \java{Object}.
It contains no instance variables, but it provides the methods \java{equals} and \java{toString}, among others.

Many classes extend \java{Object}, including almost all of the classes we have written and many Java classes, like \java{java.awt.Rectangle}.
Any class that does not explicitly name a parent inherits from \java{Object} by default.

Some inheritance chains are much longer, though.
For example, \java{javax.swing.JFrame} extends \java{java.awt.Frame}, which extends \java{Window}, which extends \java{Container}, which extends \java{Component}, which extends \java{Object}.
No matter how long the chain, \java{Object} is the common ancestor of all classes.

The ``family tree'' of classes is called the class hierarchy.
\java{Object} usually appears at the top, with all the ``child'' classes below.
If you look at the documentation of \java{JFrame}, for example, you see the part of the hierarchy that makes up \java{JFrame}'s pedigree.


\section{Abstract classes}

TODO


\section{Interfaces}
\index{interface}

GridWorld also uses Java {\bf interfaces}, so I want to explain what they are.
``Interface'' means different things in different contexts, but in Java it refers to a specific language feature: an interface is a class definition where the methods have no bodies.

In a normal class definition, each method has a prototype and a body (see Section~\ref{documentation}).
A prototype is also called a {\bf specification} because it specifies the name, parameters, and return type of the method.
The body is called the {\bf implementation} because it implements the specification.

In a Java interface the methods have no bodies, so it specifies the methods without implementing them.

For example, \java{java.awt.Shape} is an interface with prototypes for \java{contains}, \java{intersects}, and several other methods.
\java{java.awt.Rectangle} provides implementations for those methods, so we say that ``Rectangle implements Shape.''
In fact, the first line of the \java{Rectangle} class definition is:

\begin{code}
public class Rectangle extends Rectangle2D implements Shape, Serializable
\end{code}

Rectangle inherits methods from \java{Rectangle2D} and provides implementations for the methods in \java{Shape} and \java{Serializable}.

In GridWorld the Location class implements the \java{java.lang.Comparable} interface by providing \java{compareTo}, which is similar to \java{compareCards} in Section~\ref{compare}.
%
GridWorld also defines a new interface, \java{Grid}, that specifies the methods a \java{Grid} should provide.
And it includes two implementations, \java{BoundedGrid} and \java{UnboundedGrid}.

The Student Manual uses the abbreviation {\bf API}, which stands for ``application programming interface.''
The API is the set of methods that are available for you, the application programmer, to use.
See \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface}.


\section{ArrayList}

GridWorld uses \java{java.util.ArrayList}, which is an object similar to an array.
It is a {\bf collection}, which means that it's an object that contains other objects.
Java provides other collections with different capabilities, but to use GridWorld we only need \java{ArrayList}s.

To see an example, download \url{http://thinkapjava.com/code/BlueBug.java} and \url{http://thinkapjava.com/code/BlueBugRunner.java}.
A \java{BlueBug} is a bug that moves at random and looks for rocks.
If it finds a rock, it makes it blue.

Here's how it works.
When \java{act} is invoked, \java{BlueBug} gets its location and a reference to the grid:

\begin{code}
    Location loc = getLocation();
    Grid<Actor> grid = getGrid();
\end{code}

The type in angle-brackets (\verb"<>") is a {\bf type parameter} that specifies the contents of \java{grid}.
In other words, \java{grid} is not just a \java{Grid}, it's a \java{Grid} that contains \java{Actor}s.

The next step is to get the neighbors of the current location.
\java{Grid} provides a method that does just that:

\begin{code}
    ArrayList<Actor> neighbors = grid.getNeighbors(loc);
\end{code}

The return value from \java{getNeighbors} is an \java{ArrayList} of \java{Actors}.
The \java{size} method returns the length of the \java{ArrayList}, and \java{get} selects an element.
So we can print the neighbors like this.

\begin{code}
        for (int i = 0; i < neighbors.size(); i++) {
            Actor actor = neighbors.get(i);
            System.out.println(actor);
        }
\end{code}

Traversing an \java{ArrayList} is such a common operation there's a special syntax for it: the {\bf for-each loop}.
So we could write:

\begin{code}
        for (Actor actor : neighbors) {
            System.out.println(actor);
        }
\end{code}

We know that the neighbors are \java{Actors}, but we don't know what kind: they could be \java{Bug}s, \java{Rock}s, etc.
To find the Rocks, we use the \java{instanceof} operator, which checks whether an object is an instance of a class.

\begin{code}
        for (Actor actor : neighbors) {
            if (actor instanceof Rock) {
                actor.setColor(Color.blue);
            }
        }
\end{code}

To make all this work, we need to import the classes we use:

\begin{code}
import info.gridworld.actor.Actor;
import info.gridworld.actor.Bug;
import info.gridworld.actor.Rock;
import info.gridworld.grid.Grid;
import info.gridworld.grid.Location;

import java.awt.Color;
import java.util.ArrayList;
\end{code}


\section{Game of Life}

The mathematician John Conway invented the ``Game of Life,'' which he called a ``zero-player game'' because no players are needed to choose strategies or make decisions.
After you set up the initial conditions, you watch the game play itself.
But that turns out to be more interesting than it sounds; you can read about it at \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conways_Game_of_Life}.

The goal of this exercise is to implement the Game of Life in GridWorld.
The game board is the grid, and the pieces are Rocks.

The game proceeds in turns, or {\bf time steps}.
At the beginning of the time step, each Rock is either ``alive'' or ``dead''.
On the screen, the color of the Rock indicates its status.
%
The status of each Rock depends on the status of its {\bf neighbors}.
Each Rock has 8 neighbors, except the Rocks along the edge of the Grid.
Here are the rules:

\begin{itemize}

\item If a dead Rock has exactly three neighbors, it comes to life!
Otherwise it stays dead.

\item If a live Rock has 2 or 3 neighbors, it survives.
Otherwise it dies.

\end{itemize}

There are several consequences of these rules.
If all Rocks are dead, no Rocks come to life.
If you start with a single live Rock, it dies.
But if you have 4 Rocks in a square, they keep each other alive, so that's a stable configuration.

Most simple starting configurations either die out quickly or reach a stable configuration.
But there are a few starting conditions that display remarkable complexity.
One of those is the r-pentomino: it starts with only 5 Rocks, runs for 1103 timesteps and ends in a stable configuration with 116 live Rocks (see \url{http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/R-pentomino}).

The following sections are suggestions for implementing Game of Life in GridWorld.
You can download my solution at \url{http://thinkapjava.com/code/LifeRunner.java} and \url{http://thinkapjava.com/code/LifeRock.java}.


\section{LifeRunner}

Make a copy of \java{BugRunner.java} named \java{LifeRunner.java} and add methods with the following prototypes:

\begin{code}
    /**
     * Makes a Game of Life grid with an r-pentomino.
     */
    public static void makeLifeWorld(int rows, int cols)

    /**
     * Fills the grid with LifeRocks.
     */
    public static void makeRocks(ActorWorld world)
\end{code}

\java{makeLifeWorld} should create a Grid of Actors and an ActorWorld, then invoke \java{makeRocks}, which should put a \java{LifeRock} at every location in the Grid.


\section{LifeRock}

Make a copy of \java{BoxBug.java} named \java{LifeRock.java}.
\java{LifeRock} should extend \java{Rock}.
Add an \java{act} method that does nothing.
At this point you should be able to run the code and see a Grid full of Rocks.

To keep track of the status of the Rocks, you can add a new instance variable, or you can use the Color of the Rock to indicate status.
Either way, write methods with these prototypes:

\begin{code}
    /**
     * Returns true if the Rock is alive.
     */
    public boolean isAlive()

    /**
     * Makes the Rock alive.
     */
    public void setAlive()

    /**
     * Makes the Rock dead.
     */
    public void setDead()
\end{code}

Write a constructor that invokes \java{setDead} and confirm that all Rocks are dead.


\section{Simultaneous updates}

In the Game of Life, all Rocks are updated simultaneously; that is, each rock checks the status of its neighbors before any Rocks change their status.
Otherwise the behavior of the system would depend on the order of the updates.

In order to implement simultaneous updates, I suggest that you write an \java{act} method that has two phases: during the first phase, all Rocks count their neighbors and record the results; during the second phase, all Rocks update their status.

Here's what my \java{act} method looks like:

\begin{code}
    /**
     * Check what phase we're in and calls the appropriate method.
     * Moves to the next phase.
     */
    public void act() {
        if (phase == 1) {
            numNeighbors = countLiveNeighbors();
            phase = 2;
        } else {
            updateStatus();
            phase = 1;
        }
    }
\end{code}

\java{phase} and \java{numNeighbors} are instance variables.
And here are the prototypes for \java{countLiveNeighbors} and \java{updateStatus}:

\begin{code}
    /**
     * Counts the number of live neighbors.
     */
    public int countLiveNeighbors()

    /**
     * Updates the status of the Rock (live or dead) based on
     * the number of neighbors.
     */
    public void updateStatus()
\end{code}

Start with a simple version of \java{updateStatus} that changes live rocks to dead and vice versa.
Now run the program and confirm that the Rocks change color.
Every two steps in the World correspond to one timestep in the Game of Life.

Now fill in the bodies of \java{countLiveNeighbors} and \java{updateStatus} according to the rules and see if the system behaves as expected.


\section{Initial conditions}

To change the initial conditions, you can use the GridWorld pop-up menus to set the status of the Rocks by invoking \java{setAlive}.
Or you can write methods to automate the process.

In \java{LifeRunner}, add a method called \java{makeRow} that creates an initial configuration with \java{n} live Rocks in a row in the middle of the grid.
What happens for different values of \java{n}?

Add a method called \java{makePentomino} that creates an r-pentomino in the middle of the Grid.
The initial configuration should look like this:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=2in]{figs/LifeRunner.pdf}
\end{center}

If you run this configuration for more than a few steps, it reaches the end of the Grid.
The boundaries of the Grid change the behavior of the system; in order to see the full evolution of the r-pentomino, the Grid has to be big enough.
You might have to experiment to find the right size, and depending on the speed of your computer, it might take a while.

The Game of Life web page describes other initial conditions that yield interesting results (\url{http://www.conwaylife.com/}).
Choose one you like and implement it.

There are also variations of the Game of Life based on different rules.
Try one out and see if you find anything interesting.


\section{Vocabulary}

\begin{description}

\term{object method}
A method that is invoked on an object, and that operates on that object.
%, which is referred to by the keyword \java{this} in Java
% or ``the current object'' in English.
Object methods do not have the keyword \java{static}.

\term{class method}
A method with the keyword \java{static}.
Class methods are not invoked on objects and they do not have a current object.

\term{current object}
The object on which an object method is invoked.
Inside the method, the current object is referred to by \java{this}.

%\item[\java{this}:]  The keyword that refers to the current object.

\term{implicit}
Anything that is left unsaid or implied.
Within an object method, you can refer to the instance variables implicitly (i.e., without naming the object).

\term{explicit}
Anything that is spelled out completely.
Within a class method, all references to the instance variables have to be explicit.

\end{description}


\section{Exercises}


\begin{exercise}
Starting with a copy of \java{BlueBug.java}, write a class definition for a new kind of \java{Bug} that finds and eats flowers.
You can ``eat'' a flower by invoking \java{removeSelfFromGrid} on it.
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
Now you know what you need to know to read Part 3 of the GridWorld Student Manual and do the exercises.
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
If you implemented the Game of Life, you are well prepared for Part 4 of the GridWorld Student Manual.
Read it and do the exercises.
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}

Download \url{http://thinkapjava.com/code/CardSoln2.java} and \url{http://thinkapjava.com/code/CardSoln3.java}.

\java{CardSoln2.java} contains solutions to the exercises in the previous chapter.
It uses only class methods (except the constructors).

\java{CardSoln3.java} contains the same program, but most of the methods are object methods.
I left \java{merge} unchanged because I think it is more readable as a class method.

Transform \java{merge} into an object method, and change \java{mergeSort} accordingly.
Which version of \java{merge} do you prefer?

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}

Transform the following class method into an object method.

\begin{code}
public static double abs(Complex c) {
    return Math.sqrt(c.real * c.real + c.imag * c.imag);
}
\end{code}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
Transform the following object method into a class method.

\begin{code}
public boolean equals(Complex b) {
    return(real == b.real && imag == b.imag);
}
\end{code}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}

This exercise is a continuation of Exercise~\ref{ex.rational}.
The purpose is to practice the syntax of object methods and get familiar with the relevant error messages.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Transform the methods in the \java{Rational} class from class methods to object methods, and make the necessary changes in \java{main}.

\item Make a few mistakes.
Try invoking class methods as if they were object methods and vice-versa.
Try to get a sense for what is legal and what is not, and for the error messages that you get when you mess up.

\item Think about the pros and cons of class and object methods.
Which is more concise (usually)?
Which is a more natural way to express computation (or, maybe more fairly, what kind of computations can be expressed most naturally using each style)?

\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
The goal of this exercise is to write a program that generates random poker hands and classifies them, so that we can estimate the
probability of the various poker hands.
If you don't play poker, you can read about it here \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands}.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Start with \url{http://thinkapjava.com/code/CardSoln3.java} and make sure you can compile and run it.

\item Write a definition for a class named \java{PokerHand} that extends \java{Deck}.

\item Write a \java{Deck} method named \java{deal} that creates a PokerHand, transfers cards from the deck to the hand, and returns the hand.

\item In \java{main} use \java{shuffle} and \java{deal} to generate and print four \java{PokerHands} with five cards each.
Did you get anything good?

\item Write a \java{PokerHand} method called \java{hasFlush} returns a boolean indicating whether the hand contains a flush.

\item Write a method called \java{hasThreeKind} that indicates whether the hand contains Three of a Kind.

\item Write a loop that generates a few thousand hands and checks whether they contain a flush or three of a kind.
Estimate the probability of getting one of those hands.
Compare your results to the probabilities at \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands}.

\item Write methods that test for the other poker hands.
Some are easier than others.
You might find it useful to write some general-purpose helper methods that can be used for more than one test.

\item In some poker games, players get seven cards each, and they form a hand with the best five of the seven.
Modify your program to generate seven-card hands and recompute the probabilities.

\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
