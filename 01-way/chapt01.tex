\chapter{The way of the program}

The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer scientist.
This way of thinking combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science.
Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (specifically computations).
Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating trade-offs among alternatives.
And like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.

\index{problem-solving}

The single most important skill for a computer scientist is {\bf problem-solving}.
It involves the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express solutions clearly and accurately.
As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to develop problem-solving skills.
That's why this chapter is called, ``The way of the program.''

On one level you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself.
But on another level you will use programming as a means to an end.
As we go along, that end will become clearer.
Learning how to think in terms of computation is much more valuable than simply learning how to write code.


\section{What is programming?}

\index{program}

A {\bf program} is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation.
%\footnote{This definition does not apply to all programming languages; for alternatives, see \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming}.}
The computation might be something mathematical, like solving a system of equations or finding the roots of a polynomial.
It can also be a symbolic computation, like searching and replacing text in a document or (strangely enough) compiling a program.
The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language.

\begin{description}
\item[input:] Get data from the keyboard, a file, a sensor, or some other device.
\item[output:] Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.
\item[math:] Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and division.
\item[decisions:] Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate code.
\item[repetition:] Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.
\end{description}

\index{programming}

Believe it or not, that's pretty much all there is to it.
Every program you've ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of instructions that look much like these.
So you can think of {\bf programming} as the process of breaking down a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks.
The process continues until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with the basic instructions provided by computer hardware.


\section{What is computer science?}

One of the most interesting aspects of writing programs is deciding how to solve a particular problem, especially when there are multiple solutions.
For example, there are numerous ways to sort a list of numbers, and each way has its advantages (see e.g., \url{http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/}).
In order to determine which way is best for a given situation, we need techniques for describing and analyzing solutions formally.
That is where computer science comes in.

\index{computer science}
\index{algorithm}

Put simply, {\bf computer science} is the science of algorithms, including their discovery and analysis.
An {\bf algorithm} is a sequence of steps that specify exactly how to solve a problem.
Some algorithms are better than others in terms of low long they take or how much memory they use.
As you learn to develop algorithms for problems you haven't solved before, you also learn to think like a computer scientist.
%It's much more fun to discover new algorithms than to write the code for solutions that other people came up with!

\index{bug}
\index{debugging}

Designing algorithms and writing code is difficult and error-prone.
For historical reasons, programming errors are called {\bf bugs}, and the process of tracking them down and correcting them is called {\bf debugging}.
As you learn to debug your programs, you will develop new problem-solving skills.
You will need to think creatively when unexpected errors happen.

%In the old days, computer scientists had to deal with real bugs flying into their systems.
%You probably won't have that problem, but you will need to think creatively when unexpected errors happen.

%\begin{figure}[!h]
%\includegraphics[height=2.2in]{firstbug.jpg}
%\caption{The first computer bug, taped to Grace Hopper's log book in 1947.
%\\ She discovered the moth in an electromagnetic relay of the Mark II.}
%\end{figure}

% ABD: I don't love this particular piece of mythology, partly because it's not accurate, and partly because stories about the old days bore students.

Although it can be frustrating, debugging is an intellectually rich, challenging, and interesting part of computer programming.
In some ways, debugging is like detective work.
You are confronted with clues, and you have to infer the processes and events that led to the results you see.
Thinking about how to correct programs and improve their performance sometimes even leads to the discovery of new algorithms.


\section{Introduction to Java}

\index{high-level language}
\index{language!high-level}

The programming language you will learn is Java, which is relatively new (Sun released the first version in May 1995).
Java is an example of a {\bf high-level language}.
Other high-level languages you may have heard of include C and C++, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and Visual Basic.

\index{low-level language}
\index{language!low-level}

There are also {\bf low-level languages}, sometimes referred to as ``machine languages'' or ``assembly languages.''
Loosely speaking, computers can only run programs written in low-level languages.
So programs written in a high-level language have to be translated before they can run.
This translation takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level languages.
But the advantages of high-level languages are enormous.
As a result, low-level languages are only used for programs that need to interact directly with hardware.

\index{portable}

Due to the advantages, almost all programs are written in high-level languages.
First, it is {\em much} easier to program in a high-level language.
Programs take less time to write, are shorter and easier to read, and are more likely to be correct.
Second, high-level languages are {\bf portable}, meaning that they can run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications.
Low-level programs can only run on one kind of computer, and have to be rewritten to run on another.

\index{interpreter}

Two kinds of programs translate high-level languages into low-level languages: interpreters and compilers.
An {\bf interpreter} reads a high-level program and executes it, meaning that it does what the program says.
It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations.
% Figure 1.1 shows the structure of an interpreter.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics{interpreter.pdf}
\caption{How interpreted languages like Python and Ruby are executed.}
\end{figure}

\index{compiler}
\index{source code}
\index{object code}
\index{executable}

In contrast, a {\bf compiler} reads the entire program and translates it completely before the program starts running.
In this context, the high-level program is called the {\bf source code}, and the translated program is called the {\bf object code} or the {\bf executable}.
Once a program is compiled, you can execute it repeatedly without further translation.
As a result, compiled programs often run faster than interpreted programs.
% Figure 1.2 shows the structure of a compiler.

\index{byte code}

Java is {\em both} compiled and interpreted.
Instead of translating programs directly into machine language, the Java compiler generates {\bf byte code}.
Similar to machine language, byte code is easy (and fast) to interpret.
But it is also portable, like a high-level language.
Thus it is possible to compile a Java program on one machine, transfer the byte code to another machine, and then execute (interpret) the byte code on the other machine.
%This ability is an advantage of Java over some other high-level languages.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics{compiler.pdf}
\caption{The process of editing, compiling, and running a Java program.}
\end{figure}

Although this process may seem complicated, in most program development environments these steps are automated for you.
Usually you will only have to write a program and press a button or type a single command to compile and run it.
On the other hand, it is important to know what steps are happening in the background, so if something goes wrong you can figure out what it is.


\section{Formal languages}

\index{natural language}
\index{language!natural}

Learning a programming language is very different from learning a {\bf natural language} such as English, Spanish, or German.
The languages that people speak evolved naturally over time.
They were not designed by people, although we try to impose order on them for practical reasons.

\index{formal language}
\index{language!formal}

In contrast, {\bf formal languages} are designed by people for specific applications.
For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols.
Chemists use a formal language to represent the chemical structure of molecules.
And most importantly:

\index{programming language}
\index{language!programming}

\begin{quote}
{\bf Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to express computations.}
\end{quote}

\index{syntax}
\index{semantics}

Formal languages have strict rules about both the {\bf syntax} (structure) and the {\bf semantics} (meaning) of statements.
For example, $3 + 3 = 6$ is a syntactically correct mathematical statement, but $3\ + = 3\ \$\ 6$ is not.
$1 + 2 = 4$ uses correct syntax, but is semantically incorrect.
$H_2O$ is a syntactically correct chemical formula, but $_2Zz$ is not.

\subsection{Tokens and grammar}

\index{token}

Syntax rules come in two flavors, pertaining to tokens and grammar.
{\bf Tokens} are the basic elements of the language, like words, numbers, and chemical elements.
One of the problems with $3\ + = 3\ \$\ 6$ is that $\$$ is not a legal token in mathematics.
Similarly, $_2Zz$ is not legal because there is no element with the abbreviation $Zz$.

\index{grammar}

The second type of syntax rule pertains to the {\bf grammar} of the language, or the way tokens can be arranged.
The statement $3\ + = 3$ is structurally illegal, even though $+$ and $=$ are legal tokens, because you can't have one right after the other.
Similarly, in a chemical formula the subscript comes after the element name, not before.

\index{parse}

When you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal language, you have to figure out its structure.
This process is called {\bf parsing}, and in a natural language you learn to do it unconsciously.
For example, when you hear the statement ``the penny dropped,'' you understand that the penny is the subject and dropped is the predicate.
After you have parsed the statement, you can begin to figure out what it means.
%Assuming that you know what a penny is and what it means to drop, you will understand the general implication of this statement.

\subsection{Reading source code}

Although formal and natural languages have features in common---tokens, grammar, and meaning---there are some differences.

\begin{description}

\term{ambiguity}
Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by using contextual clues and other information.
Formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that any statement has exactly one meaning, regardless of context.

\term{redundancy}
In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, natural languages employ lots of redundancy.
As a result, they are often verbose.
Formal languages are less redundant and more concise.

\term{literalness}
Natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor.
When someone says ``the penny dropped'' there is no penny and nothing dropping.
This idiom means that someone finally realized something after a period of confusion.
In contrast, formal languages mean exactly what they say.

\end{description}

People who grow up speaking a natural language---that is, everyone---often have a hard time adjusting to formal languages.
In some ways, the difference between natural and formal language is like the difference between poetry and prose, but more so.

\begin{description}

\term{poetry}
Words are used for their sounds as well as for their meaning, and the whole poem together creates an effect or emotional response.
Ambiguity is not only common but often deliberate.

\term{prose}
The literal meaning of words is more important, and the structure contributes more meaning.
Prose is more amenable to analysis than poetry but still often ambiguous.

\term{program}
The meaning of a computer program is unambiguous and literal, and can be understood entirely by analysis of the tokens and grammar.

\end{description}

%Here are some suggestions for reading programs (and other formal languages).
Remember that formal languages are much more dense than natural languages, so it takes longer to read them.
The structure is very important, so it is not always a good idea to read from top to bottom, left to right.
Over time you will learn to parse the program in your head, identifying the tokens and interpreting the structure.
Finally, the details matter.
Small errors in spelling and punctuation, which you can get away with in natural languages, can make a big difference in a formal language.


\section{The hello world program}
\label{sec:hello}

\index{hello world}

Traditionally, the first program you write when learning a new programming language is called the hello world program.
All it does is display the words ``Hello, World!''\ on the screen.
In Java, it looks like this:

\begin{code}
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // generate some simple output
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }

}
\end{code}

Note the output of this program does not include the quote marks:

\begin{stdout}
Hello, World!
\end{stdout}

\index{public}
\index{static}

Unfortunately in Java, even this simple example requires language features that are difficult to explain to beginners.
But it provides a preview of topics that we will see in detail later on.
The word \java{public} means the code can be accessed from other source files.
The word \java{static} means that memory is allocated for the program in advance.
We will discuss \java{void}, \java{String}, and \java{args} in the next few chapters.
For now, let's focus on the overall structure.

\index{class!definition}
\index{method!definition}

Java programs are made up of {\bf class} and {\bf method} definitions, which generally have the form:

\begin{code}
public class CLASSNAME {

    METHOD {
        STATEMENTS
    }

    METHOD {
        STATEMENTS
    }

}
\end{code}

\index{class!name}

Here {\tt CLASSNAME} indicates the name chosen by the programmer.
Java requires the class name to match the source file name.
In the hello world example, the file name must be {\tt Hello.java} because the class name is \java{Hello}.

\index{statement}
\index{main}

Classes define a program's methods, or named sequences of {\bf statements}.
The \java{Hello} class has only one method:

\begin{code}
    public static void main(String[] args)
\end{code}

The name and format of \java{main} is special; it marks the place in the class where execution begins.
When the program runs, it starts at the first statement in \java{main} and ends when it finishes the last statement.

\index{braces}
\index{squiggly braces}

Java uses squiggly braces (\{ and \}) to group things together.
In {\tt Hello.java}, the outermost braces (lines 1 and 8) contain the class definition, and the inner braces (lines 3 and 6) contain the definition of \java{main} method.

% ABD: It looks like we don't have line numbers in the listings.
% Is that a problem for the text here?

\index{println}
\index{statement!print}

The main method can have any number of statements, but the \java{Hello} example has only one.
It is a {\bf print statement}, meaning that it displays a message on the screen.
Confusingly, print can mean both ``display something on the screen'' and ``send something to the printer.''
%I won't say much about sending things to the printer;
In this book, we'll do all our printing on the screen.
The print statement ends with a semicolon ({\tt ;}).

\index{comments!inline}
\index{statement!comment}

Line 4 contains a {\bf comment}, or a bit of English text that explains the code that follows.
When the compiler sees \java{//}, it ignores everything from there until the end of the line.
It is a good idea to write a comment before every major block of code so that other programmers (including your future self) can understand what you meant to do.


\section{Getting started with DrJava}

\index{JDK}

In order to compile Java programs on your own computer, you will need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK).
This free software by Oracle includes tools for developing and debugging Java programs.
All the examples in this book were developed and tested using Java SE Version 7.
Later versions of Java are generally backward compatible, so if you are using a more recent version, the examples in this book should still work.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{drjava-hello.png}
\caption{Screenshot of DrJava editing the hello world program.}
\end{figure}

\index{DrJava}

We will use DrJava as the primary development environment throughout the book.
A useful feature of DrJava is the Interactions Pane at the bottom of the window.
It provides the ability to try out code quickly, without having to write a class definition and save/compile/run the program.
Refer to the DrJava documentation (\url{http://drjava.org/docs/quickstart/}) for more details.

Step-by-step instructions for installing the JDK and configuring DrJava are available on this book's website: \url{http://thinkjava.org/}

% TODO: when we have the specific URL for the install page, let's put it here.

\subsection{The command-line interface}

\index{command-line}
\index{terminal}

One of the most powerful and useful skills you can learn as a computer scientist is how to use the {\bf command-line}, also called
the {\em terminal}.
The command-line is a direct interface to the operating system.
It allows you to run programs, manage files and directories, and monitor system resources.
Many advanced tools, both for software development and general purpose computing, are available only at the command-line.

There are many good tutorials online for learning the command-line for your operating system; just search the web for ``command line tutorial.''
To get started, you only need to know four commands: how to change the working directory ({\tt cd}), list directory contents ({\tt ls}), compile Java programs ({\tt javac}), and run Java programs ({\tt java}).

% ABD: There's a conflict here between ``Find the details for your system'' and ``Here are the UNIX commands''.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=4.5in]{terminal.png}
\caption{Compiling and running {\tt Hello.java} from the command-line.}
\end{figure}

In this example, the {\tt Hello.java} source file is stored in the {\tt Desktop} directory.
After changing to that location and listing the files, we use the {\tt javac} command to compile {\tt Hello.java}.
Running {\tt ls} again, we see that the compiler generated a new file, {\tt Hello.class}, which contains the byte code.
We run the program using the {\tt java} command, which displays the output on the following line.

Note that the {\tt javac} command requires a {\em file name} (or multiple source files separated by spaces), whereas the {\tt java} command requires a single {\em class name}.
If you use DrJava, it runs these commands for you and displays the output in the Interactions Pane.

Taking time to learn this efficient and elegant way of interacting with your operating system will make you more productive as a computer user.
People who don't use the command-line don't know what they're missing.

% ABD: Maybe add a reference to Neal Stephenson's book?


\section{More printing}

You can put as many statements as you want in \java{main}.
For example, to print more than one line:

\begin{code}
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // generate some simple output
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");  // print one line
        System.out.println("How are you?");   // print another
    }

}
\end{code}

As this program demonstrates, you can put comments at the end of a line as well as on lines all by themselves.

\index{String}
\index{type!String}

Phrases that appear in quotation marks are called {\bf strings}, because they contain a sequence of characters strung together.
Strings can contain any combination of letters, numbers, punctuation marks, symbols, and even non-printable characters like tab and backspace.

\index{newline}
\index{print}
\index{statement!print}

The name \java{println} is short for ``print line.''
It appends a special character, called a {\bf newline}, that advances the cursor to the beginning of the next line.
%The next time \java{println} is invoked, the new text appears on the next line.
To display the output from multiple print statements on one line, use \java{print}:

\begin{code}
public class Goodbye {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print("Goodbye, ");
        System.out.println("cruel world");
    }

}
\end{code}

The output appears on a single line as {\tt Goodbye, cruel world}.
Notice that there is a space between the word ``Goodbye'' and the second quotation mark.
This space appears in the output, so it affects the {\em behavior} of the program.

\subsection{Code formatting}
\label{sec:formatting}

Spaces that appear outside of quotation marks generally do not affect the behavior of the program.
For example, we could have written:

\begin{code}
public class Goodbye {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.print("Goodbye, ");
System.out.println("cruel world");
}
}
\end{code}

This program would compile and run just as well as the original.
The newlines at the end of each line do not affect the program's behavior either.
So we could have also written:

\begin{code}
public class Goodbye { public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.print("Goodbye, "); System.out.println
("cruel world");}}
\end{code}

It still works, but the program is getting harder and harder to read.
Newlines and spaces are important for organizing your program visually, making it easier to understand the program and find errors when they occur.
%Formatting your code well does not take much effort, and it pays huge dividends.
%We will discuss readability and style guidelines in the next chapter.

\subsection{Escape sequences}

It is possible to print multiple lines of output in just one line of code.
You simply have to tell Java where to put the newlines.

\begin{code}
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print("Hello!\nHow are you doing?\n");
    }

}
\end{code}

The output is two lines, each ending with a newline character:

\begin{stdout}
Hello!
How are you doing?
\end{stdout}

\index{escape sequence}

The code \java{\\n} is an example of an {\bf escape sequence}, which is a sequence of characters in a string that represents a special character.
The backslash allows you to ``escape'' the string's literal interpretation.
Notice there is no space between \java{\\n} and \java{How}.
If you add a space there, there will be a space at the beginning of the second line.

\begin{table}[!h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
\java{\\n} & newline \\
\hline
\java{\\t} & tab \\
\hline
\java{\\"} & double quote \\
\hline
\java{\\\\} & backslash \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Common escape sequences}
\end{table}

Another common use of escape sequences is to have quote marks inside of strings.
Since double quotes indicate the beginning and end of strings, you need to escape them with a backslash.

\begin{code}
    System.out.println("She said \"Hello!\" to me.");
\end{code}

The result is:

\begin{stdout}
    She said "Hello!" to me.
\end{stdout}


\section{Working through examples}
\label{sec:examples}

It is a good idea to read this book in front of a computer so you can try out the examples as you go.
You can run many of the examples directly in DrJava's Interactions Pane, but if you put the code in a source file, it will be easier to try out variations.

Whenever you are experimenting with a new feature, you should also try to make mistakes.
For example, in the hello world program, what happens if you leave out one of the quotation marks?
What if you leave out both?
What if you spell \java{println} wrong?
This kind of experiment helps you remember what you read.
It also helps with debugging, because you get to know what the error messages mean.
It is better to make mistakes now and on purpose than later on and accidentally.

\index{experimental debugging}
\index{debugging!experimental}

\index{Holmes, Sherlock}
\index{Doyle, Arthur Conan}

Debugging is like an experimental science.
Once you have an idea about what is going wrong, you modify your program and try again.
If your hypothesis was correct, then you can predict the result of the modification, and you take a step closer to a working program.
If your hypothesis was wrong, you have to come up with a new one.
As Sherlock Holmes pointed out, ``When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.''
(A.~Conan Doyle, {\em The Sign of Four}.)

Programming and debugging should go hand in hand.
Don't just write a bunch of code and then perform trial and error debugging until it all works.
Instead, start with a program that does {\em something} and make small modifications, debugging them as you go, until the program does what you want.
That way you will always have a working program, and it will be easier to isolate errors.

\index{Linux}
\index{Torvalds, Linux}
\index{Greenfield, Larry}

A great example of this principle is the Linux operating system, which contains millions of lines of code.
It started out as a simple program Linus Torvalds used to explore the Intel 80386 chip.
According to Larry Greenfield, ``One of Linus's earlier projects was a program that would switch between printing AAAA and BBBB.
This later evolved to Linux.'' ({\em The Linux Users' Guide})

%Later chapters will make more suggestions about debugging and other programming practices.

Finally, programming sometimes brings out strong emotions.
If you are struggling with a difficult bug, you might feel angry, despondent, or embarrassed.
Remember that you are not alone, and most if not all programmers have had similar experiences.
Don't hesitate to reach out to a friend and ask questions!

%\index{emotional debugging}
%\index{debugging!emotional response}

%There is evidence that people naturally respond to computers as if they were people.
%When they work well, we think of them as teammates, and when they are obstinate or rude, we respond to them the same way we respond to rude, obstinate people.
%(Reeves and Nass, {\it The Media Equation: How People Treat Computers, Television, and New Media Like Real People and Places})

%Preparing for these reactions might help you deal with them.
%One approach is to think of the computer as an employee with certain strengths, like speed and precision, and particular weaknesses, like lack of empathy and inability to grasp the big picture.

%Your job is to be a good manager: find ways to take advantage of the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses.
%And find ways to use your emotions to engage with the problem, without letting your reactions interfere with your ability to work effectively.

%Learning to debug can be frustrating, but it is a valuable skill that is useful for many activities beyond programming.
%At the end of each chapter there is a debugging section, like this one, with my thoughts about debugging.
%I hope they help!
