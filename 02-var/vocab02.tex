\begin{description}

\term{string}
A sequence of characters; the primary data type for text.

\term{newline}
A special character signifying the end of a line of text.
Also known as line ending, end of line (EOL), or line break.

\term{variable}
A named storage location for values.
All variables have a type, which is declared when the variable is created.

\term{value}
A number or text that can be stored in a variable.
Every value belongs to a type (e.g., \java{int}, \java{String}).

\term{declaration}
A statement that creates a new variable and determines its type.

\term{type}
Mathematically speaking, a set of values.
The type of a variable determines which values can be stored or manipulated.
%The types we have seen are integers ({\tt int} in Java) and strings ({\tt String} in Java).

\term{keyword}
A reserved word used by the compiler to parse programs.
You cannot use keywords (like \java{public}, \java{class}, and \java{void}) as variable names.

\term{assignment}
A statement that stores a value in a memory location.

\term{literal}
A constant value written directly in the source code.
For example, \java{"Hello"} is a string literal and \java{74} is an integer literal.

\term{constant}
A variable that can only be assigned one time.
Once initialized, its value cannot be changed.

\term{initialize}
To assign an initial value to a variable (i.e., its first value).

\term{expression}
A combination of variables, operators, and values that represents a single value.
Expressions also have types, as determined by their operators and operands.

\term{operator}
A symbol that represents a computation like addition, multiplication, or string concatenation.

\term{operand}
One of the values on which an operator operates.

\term{modulus}
An operator that yields the remainder when one integer is divided by another.
In Java, it is denoted with a percent sign (e.g., \java{5 \% 2} is \java{1}).

\term{precedence}
The order in which operations are evaluated.

\term{concatenate}
To join two operands end-to-end.
For strings, concatenation means to append.

\term{composition}
The ability to combine simple expressions and statements into compound expressions and statements, making it possible to represent complex computations in a concise manner.

\term{whitespace}
Newlines, tab characters, and other spaces in a source program.
Its purpose in the Java language is to separate tokens.

\term{documentation}
Comments that describe the technical operation of a class or method.

\term{Javadoc}
A tool that reads Java source code and generates documentation in HTML format.
