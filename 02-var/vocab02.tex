\section{Vocabulary}

\begin{description}

\term{syntax error}
An error in a program that makes it impossible to parse (and therefore impossible to compile).

\term{type-safe}
A property of Java that makes it possible to catch some errors at compile time.

\term{exception}
An error in a program that makes it impossible to execute completely.
Also called a runtime error.

\term{logic error}
An error in a program that makes it do something other than what the programmer intended.

\term{variable}
A named storage location for values.
All variables have a type, which is declared when the variable is created.

\term{value}
A number or text that can be stored in a variable.
Every value belongs to a type (e.g., \java{int}, \java{String}).

\term{declaration}
A statement that creates a new variable and determines its type.

\term{type}
Mathematically speaking, a set of values.
The type of a variable determines which values can be stored or manipulated.
%The types we have seen are integers ({\tt int} in Java) and strings ({\tt String} in Java).

\term{assignment}
A statement that stores a value in a memory location.

\term{literal}
A constant value written directly in the source code.
For example, \java{"Hello"} is a string literal and \java{74} is an integer literal.

\term{constant}
A variable that can only be assigned one time.
Once initialized, its value cannot be changed.

\term{initialize}
To assign an initial value to a variable (i.e., its first value).

\term{keyword}
A reserved word used by the compiler to parse programs.
You cannot use keywords (like \java{public}, \java{class}, and \java{void}) as variable names.

\term{expression}
A combination of variables, operators, and values that represents a single value.
Expressions also have types, as determined by their operators and operands.

\term{operator}
A symbol that represents a computation like addition, multiplication, or string concatenation.

\term{operand}
One of the values on which an operator operates.

\term{floating-point}
A data type that {\em approximates} a real number (i.e., multiple decimal places).
In Java, the default floating-point type is \java{double}.

\term{concatenate}
To join two operands end-to-end.
For strings, concatenation means to append.

\term{precedence}
The order in which operations are evaluated.

\term{composition}
The ability to combine simple expressions and statements into compound expressions and statements, making it possible to represent complex computations in a concise manner.
