\chapter{Standard input and output}

A number of years ago, Jeannette Wing published a terrific editorial with the title {\it Computational Thinking}, or in her own words, ``Ways to Think Like a Computer Scientist'' (see Communications of the ACM, March 2006).
This 3-page article summarizes many of the problem-solving techniques you will discover while learning to program.
Everyone interested in learning computer science beyond programming should read it.
She defines the field this way:

\begin{quote}
{\bf ``Computer science is the study of computation---what can be computed and how to compute it.''}
\end{quote}

So far the only programs we've looked at just display messages, which doesn't involve a lot of computation.
But that will change quickly as we begin to work with different types data.
This chapter is about storing values in computer memory and doing simple arithmetic.
More importantly, it's about how to compose algorithms using basic building blocks like variables, keywords, operators, and expressions.
